      <description>The main new thing that I learned during this course was what DevOps actually means. Previously I thought it was a term that focused on continuous integration and continuous deployment but had no idea about the three ways of DevOps, the CAMS model or the fact that culture is a very important part of DevOps.
Another thing I learned about was the Hugo framework and how it worked. Before this course, I had never even heard of the Hugo framework.</description>

      <description>Below are a few points regarding what was expected of this course:
 Learning what DevOps actually means and entails. The word is used by pretty much every company nowadays and if you don&#39;t do it you are considered old fashioned. But I didn&#39;t really have any idea what the term included besides CI/CD. I expected that the course would require utilizing AWS, Azure, Google Cloud or some other cloud computing service.</description>
