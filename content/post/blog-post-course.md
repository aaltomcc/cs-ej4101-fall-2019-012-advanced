Below are a few points regarding what was expected of this course:
* Learning what DevOps actually means and entails. The word is used by pretty much every company nowadays and if you don't do it you are considered old fashioned. But I didn't really have any idea what the term included besides CI/CD.
* I expected that the course would require utilizing AWS, Azure, Google Cloud or some other cloud computing service. Therefore I also expected it to cover the basics of regarding usage of one of these platforms.
* When first hearing about this course I got very excited by the title of the course. I was slightly disappointed to find out that it was just a 1 credit online course and was hoping/expecting for a full (5 credit) course covering the aspects of DevOps. After watching the course material videos, there would certainly be much potential for a full course regarding the subject.
* After discovering that the course would be just 1 credit, I expected that the course would take a quite shallow look at the subject. While the questions and the project were quite simple, the included video course material was terrificly informative and I really felt watching them was useful for both this course and future work.
* I was expecting that this course would include more programming tasks and problem solving. However, the most time consuming part of this course was definitely doing these reflections and trying to come up with text that would fill the required word count.
