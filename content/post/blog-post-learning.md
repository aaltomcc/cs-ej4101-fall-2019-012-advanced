The main new thing that I learned during this course was what DevOps actually means. Previously I thought it was a term that focused on continuous integration and continuous deployment but had no idea about the three ways of DevOps, the CAMS model or the fact that culture is a very important part of DevOps.

Another thing I learned about was the Hugo framework and how it worked. Before this course, I had never even heard of the Hugo framework. It does seem like quite a capable framework for building static websites such as portfolios, especially considering its simplicity and the capability to get nice looking layouts by fiddling around with already available themes.

I also obviously leanred how to use Travis CI and how it worked together with GitHub pages. The two points that caused the most trouble was figuring out that Travis CI was going to build the master branch and push the output to the gh-pages branch... Spent some time tinkering with the configuration thinking that the gh-pages branch was supposed to be the source of the build pipeline. Also figuring out a simple, fast and working method of adding hugo to the Travis virtual machine also took a few attempts.

The easiest part of the course was no doubt the questionnaire. Many of the questions were easy to guess correctly even without prior DevOps knowledge. Also since the advanced project required just 15 points, getting only those would have taken next to no effort at all.
